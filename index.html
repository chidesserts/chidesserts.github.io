				<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
				<p>Chi Desserts was founded by Jacqueline Chen in 2020. She launched this small business during quarantine when she realized her passion to bake and gift. During quarantine, she would spend the majority of her time in the kitchen baking her goods and out delivering those goods to her friends. Chen saw how her baked goods could light up the smiles of her friends and decided to develop her passion into an at-home business.</p>
